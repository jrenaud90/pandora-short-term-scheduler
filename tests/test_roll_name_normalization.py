"""Regression test: target-name normalization must not orphan swept rolls.

The roll sweep keys its results by target name. The ``fix_bad_data`` feature
rewrites invalid name symbols (``+`` and space -> ``_``). If that rename runs
*after* the sweep, a renamed target's swept roll is lost and the scheduler
falls back to the continuous sun-derived roll. ``process_calendar`` therefore
normalizes target names up front (before the sweep). These tests pin that:

- a ``+``/space target keeps a *quantized* (swept) roll, not a continuous
  sun-derived fallback;
- the target name is normalized in the output.
