"""A stricter Earth-limb keepout for priority-0 observations only.

Priority-0 targets may need to be held further off the Earth so the
spacecraft can dissipate more heat. ``priority_0_earthlimb_min`` is a
second, stricter visibility model rather than a tweak to the first: a
flat limb angle with the day/night split and the dynamic DPC wedge both
switched off, leaving every other keepout alone.
