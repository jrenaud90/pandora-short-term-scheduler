## v1.5.0 (2026-08-28)
- Roll determination now runs on `pandoravisibility` (v1.4.0 or later). `roll.py` is simplified. It includes, `get_best_roll_per_visit`, which decides which minutes of a target's visit to score, how much each counts and which keepout model applies, and hands the search to `Visibility.get_best_roll`. Removed: `calculate_roll`, `find_best_roll_for_target`, `find_best_rolls_for_visit`, `calculate_visit_rolls`, `apply_rolls_to_visit`, `apply_rolls_to_calendar` and the solar power helpers, all of which restated attitude geometry and a panel model the visibility package owns. `calculate_roll`, `apply_rolls_to_visit` and `apply_rolls_to_calendar` are no longer exported from `shortschedule`.
  - The roll is chosen by: rolls below `min_power_frac` are dropped; of the rest, the one with the most scheduled minutes where boresight and star trackers pass wins; then the most visible minutes in the growth margin (`max_movement_minutes` on each side of every observation, so growth has somewhere to go, but only ever as a tie-break); then the highest mean solar power. On the 2026-08-17 week this gives the same visible-minute count as before for every target-visit, with equal or higher panel power, and the roll step takes about 3 s instead of 47 s. End to end on that week: the same 110 observations and 0 overlaps, 70 observations grew by 2 to 7 minutes into margin minutes the new roll keeps visible and none shrank, observing time 75.2 to 80.0 hours, and the full run 66 s to 35 s.
  - The sun-derived fallback is gone. When no roll makes a scheduled minute visible, the roll best for the star trackers alone (then the best-lit roll) is written and an error is logged naming the visit and target, where the sweep used to fall back silently.
  - The sweep runs whether or not star tracker keepouts are active. With them off it returns the best-lit roll, which is what the sun-derived roll was.
  - Rolls are written onto each observation as soon as they are chosen, before any timing pass, and observations rebuilt by the trim and grow passes now carry their roll.
  - `roll_step` defaults to 1 deg (was 2), since the sweep no longer makes it expensive.
  - The mixed-priority rule is unchanged: a target is scored under the priority-0 model only when every one of its observations in the visit is priority 0.
  - The per-visit roll cache (`_computed_target_rolls`) and the sweep gate (`_roll_sweep_enabled`) are gone. Every timing pass, `validate_visibility`, the visibility Gantt and the pointing timeline read the roll written on the observation, which removes the three ways the cache could disagree with the delivered calendar: a target renamed after the sweep, a visit renumbered after it, and a calendar loaded from XML on a processor that never ran. `build_pointing_timeline` lost its `computed_rolls` argument.
- Removed `docs/roll-aware-visibility-example.ipynb`, which was built on the removed roll functions. `docs/run_scheduler_example.py` is the reference workflow.
- Adds `grow_by_priority` (default `True`). The growth pass walks priority 2 first, then 1, then 0, and a higher-priority observation may take minutes from an adjacent lower-priority one, as far as visibility allows, while that one keeps `min_sequence_duration` once the start-buffer pass has cleaned its opening, and its moved boundary stays within `max_movement_minutes` of its long-term time. Growth that visibility allowed but a lower-priority neighbor's floor refused is logged as an error naming both observations and the minutes not taken. Equal and higher-priority neighbors stay hard bounds, and `False` restores the start-time walk with every neighbor a hard bound. The flag is written to the calendar header as `Grow_By_Priority`; `processing_summary` gains `minutes_taken_from_lower_priority`.
- Progress bars on every step that takes more than a moment on a week: growth, merging, the start buffers, the pointing timeline behind the three pointing plots, and the visibility Gantt join the roll sweep, the two trims and `validate_visibility`, which already had them. `build_pointing_timeline` takes an optional `progress` callable so the bar logic stays in one place. As before, the bars only show on an interactive terminal.
- `plot_earth_illumination` now puts the angle to the Earth center on the x axis and the Earth illumination angle on the y axis, and draws the Earth keep-out each direction is held to in the same coordinates.
- The run log records changes only. An integration count recomputed to the value already on the observation is no longer written. Every `SHRANK` and `ELONGATED` line now ends with why each boundary moved and by how much: a dark tail trimmed, the longest visible block kept, growth into idle time, minutes taken from or given to a neighbor by priority, a start moved later to open cleanly, a clamp to the movement limit, or a truncation to end an overlap.

## v1.4.0 (2026-08-27)
- Picks up the `pandoravisibility` v1.3.0 defaults, which are Pandora's flight keepouts rather than a loose starting point.
  - Fixes the roll sweep switching itself off. `_roll_sweep_enabled` was derived from the constructor arguments, so a scheduler that inherited the library's star-tracker keepouts applied them while never sweeping for a roll that could satisfy them. It now reads `Visibility._st_constraint_active`, falling back to the arguments only for a duck-typed visibility object that has no such attribute.
  - Note for callers: `None` no longer means "switch this keepout off". It means "defer to `pandoravisibility`", which now supplies a real angle for every keepout including the star-tracker ones. Pass `0` to disable one. `docs/roll-aware-visibility-example.ipynb` built its no-star-tracker comparison arm with `st_sun_min=None` and friends, which now gives that arm the full tracker keepouts, so it passes zeros instead.
  - Fixes `priority_0_earthlimb_min` no longer being a flat angle. The day/night pair was removed from the priority-0 keyword dict with `pop`, which only means "do not pass it", so `Visibility` fell back to its own defaults. Those are real angles since v1.3.0 and would have set the threshold instead of the flat angle the caller asked for. They are now sent as an explicit `None`.
- `validate_visibility` asks for its constraint breakdown at the roll the observation will actually fly. `get_all_constraints` gained a `roll` argument in `pandoravisibility` v1.3.0; without it the `star_tracker` verdict described the model's own attitude and could contradict the visibility result it was reporting on.
  - The per-tracker rows come from `get_star_tracker_breakdown`, which shares its geometry with that verdict, rather than being rebuilt from `get_star_tracker_angles`. The old path also measured the Earth limb from the geodetic horizon instead of the geocentric one the keepout is tested against.
  - The reported Earth-limb threshold reads the observer geometry from `Visibility._precompute` rather than rebuilding it.
  - The `side` label reports the Earth illumination angle while the dynamic wedge is in use. It was inferred by matching the effective threshold against `earthlimb_day_min`, which a continuous wedge never equals, so every step read as "night".

## v1.3.1 (2026-08-19)
- Fixed an issue when an observation is below the minimum observing time then it was not triggering an error.

## v1.3.0 (2026-08-19)
- `Calendar_Status` in the delivered XML header now reflects whether the run failed, not whether a validator just marked something as not visible. 
- Records the configuration the run applied on the XML header, so a delivered calendar says what it was built under instead of leaving it to be reconstructed from a log: the gap tolerances and their start buffers, `Max_Movement_Min`, `Roll_Step_Deg`, `Min_Power_Frac`, and every keepout in degrees including `Priority_0_Earthlimb_Min_Deg` (written only when in use) and `Use_Dynamic_Earthlimb`.
- Adds `priority_0_earthlimb_min` (default `None`), a stricter boresight Earth-limb keepout applied to priority-0 observations only, so they can be held further off the Earth to dissipate more heat. Every other keepout, star trackers included, is unchanged. `None` leaves the scheduler behaving exactly as before.
- Replaces blind gap filling with in-place adjustment. `_fill_gaps` dragged every observation's start back right at the one before it, unchecked and unbounded, and `_fix_visibility` then cleaned up the dark minutes that were created; between them they moved many observations by significant fractions since calendars now carry a lot of free time. Neither is called any more. Idle time is expected under the current conops, so observations keep the times the long-term calendar gave them and are only trimmed and grown in place.
  - `gap_report` now records what the passes did rather than how many gaps were closed, which is no longer something the scheduler attempts: `sequences_modified` split into grown and trimmed, `minutes_grown_at_starts`/`_at_stops`, `boundaries_clamped` and `overlaps_repaired`. `print_gap_summary` and the comparison plot report those. This also fixes `Sequences Modified`, which had been printing 0 on every run since long before this release because nothing ever wrote it.
- Adds `_grow_into_free_time` to gain back the observing time the removed gap filling used to achieve. Each observation expands outwards into adjacent idle time while the target stays visible at its scheduled roll, bounded by its neighbors and by `max_movement_minutes`, stepping over any dip the gap tolerances accept and always stopping on a visible minute.
- Adds `max_movement_minutes` (default 45): neither boundary of an observation may end up further than this from where the long-term calendar put it, or it is clamped there and reported in the error log, since a target needing to move that far is not really visible near its planned time or the long-term scheduler is not calculating visibility correctly.
- Adds an overlap guard that runs last and in both modes. The passes above cannot produce an overlap, but if one appears the earlier observation's stop is truncated to the later one's start and the repair logged, and anything still overlapping is reported for a manual fix.
- Merging can now absorb a short keepout violation between two observations of the same target, instead of letting it split them.
- `process_calendar(merge_similar_observations=...)` now defaults to `True`.
- Every product of a run now lands beside the long-term calendar it came from, rather than in whatever directory the run was launched from.
- Removes dead code left over from the gap-filling design. Gone: `_fill_gaps` and `_fix_visibility` (no longer called), `_trim_non_visible_heads` (never called; a dark head is trimmed by `_trim_to_longest_visible_block`, whose selected span has its leading dark minutes stripped), `max_sequence_duration` (set but never read, so growth was never capped by it), and the whole `force_gap_fill` mode with `_force_fill_gaps`, `_classify_gap_minute` and `earthlimb_hard_floor`. `force_gap_fill` was a constructor argument, so passing it is now an error; `docs/run_scheduler_example.py` no longer does. Output on the real week is unchanged.
- Adds `earthlimb_gap_tolerance_start_buffer` (default 12 min), the boresight counterpart to `st_gap_tolerance_start_buffer`. The gap tolerance may not be spent at the very beginning of an observation: an observation that opens with the boresight inside the Earth-limb keepout is not worth starting. Both buffers are enforced together, because moving the start to clear one can push it into a violation of the other. `_enforce_st_start_buffer` is accordingly now `_enforce_start_buffers`.
- Fixes keepout defaults silently diverging from `pandoravisibility`. `moon_min`, `sun_min`, and `earthlimb_min` restated the library's defaults in `ScheduleProcessor.__init__`, and `moon_min` had drifted to 20 deg against the library's 25 deg, so a scheduler built without an explicit moon keepout quietly used a looser one. All keepouts now default to `None`, meaning the constraint is left out of the `Visibility` call and that package's own default applies. Configurations that pass their keepouts explicitly, including `docs/run_scheduler_example.py`, are unaffected.
- Fixes the roll sweep running when no star-tracker constraint is active. The sweep was gated on whether a star-tracker argument had been *passed*, but a limit of zero disables that keepout, so `st_sun_min=0` switched on a full roll sweep for constraints that were never applied. The gate now tests for a limit greater than zero.
- Folds the day/night Earth-limb keepouts into the single forwarding dict rather than a second special-cased path, so a keepout cannot reach `Visibility` on one path and not the other.
- Fixes an observation exactly `min_sequence_duration` long being rejected as too short. Subtracting two `Time` objects an exact 8 minutes apart does not give 480 s: it gives 479.9999999999983 s at some epochs and 480.0000000000079 s at others, so the six passes that shorten an observation and then check the result were deciding on the date rather than on the schedule.
- Adds pointing plots, Every target gets its own color across all three, with black reserved for idle.
  - `plot_pointing_timeline` — boresight right ascension and declination across the week.
  - `plot_keepout_angles` — 3x3 grid of Sun, Earth and Moon angle for the boresight and each star tracker, with the configured Sun and Moon keep-outs drawn. The Earth row is the angle to the Earth centre, so no keep-out line is drawn on it; the Earth keep-outs are limb relative.
  - `plot_earth_illumination` — Earth-centre angle against how sunlit the limb point each axis grazes is, which is the angle the dynamic DPC wedge is keyed on.
  - All three share one `PointingTimeline` per calendar, so a full set costs about what one costs (~10 s on a week). `docs/run_scheduler_example.py` saves all three beside the calendar.
- Visibility plot improvements:
  - Fixes the visibility Gantt evaluating visibility at the wrong roll. It read the scheduler's swept-roll cache, which is only populated when that same processor instance built the schedule, so plotting a calendar loaded from XML judged the star trackers at the default attitude: 1066 min painted non-visible against a true 2. It now uses the roll written onto each observation, which is the one that will be flown.
  - Splits each bar in the visibility Gantt: the upper half keeps the priority color, the lower half shows the prescribed roll.
  - Adds a duty-cycle line to the visibility Gantt title: observed minutes against the wall-clock span they cover, so idle time counts against it.

## v1.2.3 (2026-08-19)
- Adds `st_gap_tolerance_start_buffer` (default 12 min). The star trackers must be visible for that many minutes at the beginning of every observation, measured from its start time, with no gap tolerance applied; without it the spacecraft cannot acquire good pointing. Observations that open with a tracker dropout have their start trimmed forward to the first minute that clears the buffer. Ones that cannot be fixed, because no stretch of the observation clears it or because trimming would drop below the minimum duration, are left alone and reported in the error log.
- Fixes gap tolerance being judged at the wrong roll. `_is_gap_tolerable` took its star-tracker verdict from `get_all_constraints`, which accepts no roll argument and so always evaluated the trackers at the `Visibility` instance's roll rather than the roll the observation actually flies. The tracker check now goes through `get_star_tracker_breakdown` at the swept roll. A sun/moon/planet keepout failure is now also explicitly never tolerable, rather than falling through the classification.
- A star-tracker check that cannot be evaluated is now reported to the error log instead of being inferred from whether the boresight was clear. The gap is then treated as intolerable and trimmed away.
